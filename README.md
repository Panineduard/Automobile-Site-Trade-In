# volkswagenTradeIn
Itâ€™s a website with user registration and administration for sale car. Every user has an account with data.
I used Spring(MVC, IoC, Security, Scheduling, MailSender) and Hibernate. I used xml file for setting project(parse with JAXB).
I used Spring MailSender with SMPT and Scheduling for sending email to users automatically.
PostgreSQL DB server is used for persisting data.  I used AWT for create captcha in registration. 
I used Scheduling for clean DB automatically. I write JavaScript(JQuery) for JSP pages. 
Then I bought VPS server and start this project on Apache and Tomcat servers.
